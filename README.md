# git-reset-main-to-tag-script
This script allows you to perform a "rollback" of the `main` branch to a release tag (or any commit tag) and invalidate the most recent commits. This is useful when you want a pre-release version to become the new `main`, and you want to invalidate the subsequent commits.
